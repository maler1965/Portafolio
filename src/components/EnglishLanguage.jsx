                I am passionate about mathematics and electronics. Originally from Ecuador, I currently reside in a small town in the Ecuadorian Oriente, located in the fascinating region of the Amazon.

                From an early age, I felt drawn to the world of exact sciences and decided to pursue a career as a Mathematical Physicist during my high school years. I graduated in Electronic Design. During my studies, I gained skills in making electronic boards using empty microchips and programming them on my own. Using computer aided design programs, CAB, and low-level languages such as assembler or assembler, ASM, I was able to develop projects such as alarms, remote controls, etc.

                For a decade, I worked in a branch in Guayaquil, working in electrical and electronic maintenance. However, I decided to go my own way and now I work independently. I have established a small workshop dedicated to the repair and maintenance of electrical and electronic machinery.

                In addition, a few years ago, I studied cabinetmaking and obtained the master's degree granted by the Ministry of Labor of Ecuador. This combination of knowledge has allowed me to complement my work in the field of electricity and electronics with the manufacture of wooden furniture. I have used my experience in electrical and electronic machinery to create my own cabinetmaking tools and bring to life a small furniture making workshop using local wood.

                In my search for knowledge and professional growth, I decided to enroll in the ACADEMLO academy to study programming. Currently, we are in the second study module. My goal is to immerse myself in the fascinating world of programming and have the ability to create my own projects or work for a company that shares my passion for technology.
                <br />
                <br />

                I am excited by the opportunities that the field of programming offers me and I am willing to face new challenges to continue growing and developing myself as a professional. My goal is to contribute with innovative and creative solutions that make a difference in the technological field.

                Thank you for reading my presentation and for considering my profile.
                <br />
                <br />
                I am excited for what the future holds for me and I look forward to sharing my enthusiasm and knowledge with the world of programming. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges in this exciting industry!</p>
